CS50 Final Project: Weather Web Application

NOTE: UPON INITIALLY LOADING THE APPLICATION THROUGH CS50 IDE, NO LOCATION WILL BE DISPLAYED. THIS IS A BUG WITHIN THE CS50 IDE
ITSELF WHERE A https:// WEB DOMAIN IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN THE USER'S CURRENT GEOLOCATION. SO, JUST ADD "https://" TO THE BEGINNING
OF THE URL AFTER THE FIRST TIME THE APPLICATION IS LOADED AND IT WILL DISPLAY THE INFROMATION FOR YOUR CURRENT LOCATION. SORRY
FOR THIS INCONVENIENCE, IF WE HAD THE ABILITY TO BUILD OUR PROJECT ON A PERSONAL WEB DOMAIN WE WOULD MAKE SURE TO USE A SECURE URL.

Welcome to our Weather App!

Upon loading the url of the website (and following the above directions) you will reach a webpage that displays the current temperature,
conditions, precipitation, humidity, and wind speed of your location. At the bottom of the block on the left you have the ability to
toggle between Fahrenheit and Celcius for the current temperature. To the right of the page lies an interactive map. Upon opening the
page the map will automatically be zoomed into your current location and display a marker there. We have enabled click functionality,
so that you can click anywhere on the map, and the weather will be updated immediately for that desired location. If you are looking
for thge weather at a specific location, you can utilize the search bar at the top of the page. At the bottom of the page lies a
7 day forecast of highs and lows for your location. We also utilized the DarkSky API's Skycons, so each temperature will be accompanied
by an appropriate icon.
